## What Is It?
* This is a personal website created using ReactJS and CSS
* My website is a visual presentation of my career so far
* A static website hosted on GitHub Pages
* This is my v2 of my personal site as my v1 had terrible styling (see branch...). After brushing up on my CSS skills through online articles and making another website, I revamp'd the CSS after having better experience with `flexbox` and object-oriented CSS

## Features Of This Project
* Easy maintainability as web content are all stored in JSON data
* Simple animations using `@keyframes` to achieve a more modern and minimalistic feel
* Hover elements in Navbar and buttons 

## Things I Learned While Making This Project
* CSS is still hard
