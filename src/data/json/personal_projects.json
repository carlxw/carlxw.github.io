It took me about 3 days to get through TheNetNinja's ReactJS tutorials and then essentially forever to get this website up and going. If I have any regrets in life, that would be having a preference in improvising over planning. Oh my god I am 100% going to recode this from ground up when I have the time to do so. With that being said, my suggestion to you, dear reader, is to NOT checkout the CSS in the GitHub and intentinally resize this window :)"
