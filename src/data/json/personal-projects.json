Firstly, what the heck, YouTube. Not cool. Secondly, I pondered if I could remake the bot myself. An innocent Google search and a few YouTube videos eventually led me to develop a fully functional backend bot that I now locally host on my Raspberry Pi using a Python script. This is one of my first major successes with programming and remains to be my proudest achievement.",

        "story": "It was all one day when a friend of mine asked me to sign up with him for a hackathon hosted at his university. I was like 'why the heck not'! After all, this seems like it'd be a good opportunity to see how good my coding skills are (spoiler alert: I was humbled much). We created a IPFS uploader for medical practioners to upload data-sensitive documents on to the Ethereum blockchain. As the one in charge of the backend, I initially intended to use Verbwire to do the uploading, but the documentation example doesn't work, and so I switched to use Moralis instead. Funnily enough, this still won 'Most Innovative Use of Verbwire API' thanks to our ingenious idea. That, or a challenge with awards for 10 groups, got only 10 groups signing up.",

If I had any regrets in life, that would be having a preference in improvising over planning. Oh my god I am 100% going to recode this from ground-up when I have the time to do so.
